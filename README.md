# Arizona-Fatal-Police-Shootings

## Project Description

This project was conducted during a senior statistics seminar at Hamilton College. Leveraging a dataset sourced from The Washington Post, which meticulously compiles data on fatal police shootings across the United States, the assignment tasked students with delving into the dataset to unearth intriguing relationships for further exploration.

Participants took a regional approach, dissecting the dataset to discern specific geographical correlations with shootings and crime. This particular project honed in on the state of Arizona, giving special attention to its most populous cities, including Phoenix, Tucson, and Mesa.

To enrich our analysis, we supplemented the dataset with information from policeinitiative.org, crimegrade.org, and other demographic data. This comprehensive approach provided deeper insights into the intricate dynamics between population density, geographic location, and heightened interactions with law enforcement, ultimately shedding light on fatal police shootings.
